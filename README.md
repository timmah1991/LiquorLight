# LiquorLight

Simple, glowing light that installs at the top of an emptied glass bottle for interesting visual effect.

Project includes a circuit board and a manufactured plastic enclosure. The enclosure for this project was designed for additive manufacturing, and can easily be retrofitted for injection molding by adding a few chamfers and adjusting extrusion angles.
